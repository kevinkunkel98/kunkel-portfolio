KDE Plasma is a highly costumizable and functional Desktop Environment that can look really stunning.
This is my first attempt at making it my own OS! Maybe next time I try a window manager like i3, I'm going to rice it and post it here.

## What I used


* Icon theme: Papyrus Dark
* Global theme: Layan
* Window decoration: Layan-solid
* Terminal file explorer: Ranger
